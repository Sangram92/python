# With Selection sort, we divide our input list / array into two parts.
# The sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted 
# that make up the rest of the list. We first find the smallest element in the unsorted sublist 
# and place it at the end of the sorted sublist. Thus, we are continuously grabbing the smallest 
# unsorted element and placing it in sorted order in the sorted sublist. This process continues 
# iteratively until the list is fully sorted.

# complexity of O(nÂ²)
